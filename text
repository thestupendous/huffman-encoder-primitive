The decoding process needs a convenient representation for the prefix code so
that we can easily pick off the initial codeword. A binary tree whose leaves are
the given characters provides one such representation. We interpret the binary
codeword for a character as the simple path from the root to that character, where 0
means “go to the left child” and 1 means “go to the right child.” Figure 16.4 shows
the trees for the two codes of our example. Note that these are not binary search
trees, since the leaves need not appear in sorted order and internal nodes do not
contain character keys.
